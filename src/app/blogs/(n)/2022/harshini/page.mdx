### Preface

When I first joined VITeach, I thought I would simply be helping children with their studies.  
But soon, I realized that the lessons we shared went far **beyond books**.

---

## The Experience

The kids taught me about:

- Innocence in questions
- Pure joy in small things
- Courage to dream big

Every interaction was a reminder that education is not just about subjects — it’s about nurturing hearts and minds.

---

## What I Learned

From my journey in VITeach, I learned:

- Compassion is as important as knowledge
- Patience and consistency create lasting change
- True education transforms both the student and the teacher

---

## Reflection

These children gave me more than I could ever give them.  
Their enthusiasm, energy, and smiles will always stay with me.

VITeach made me realize that the most valuable lessons in life are the ones that go **beyond books**.
