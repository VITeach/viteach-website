# The Gift of Giving

_By Rashmi (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

I always believed that giving meant parting with something valuable.  
But after joining **VITeach**, I realized that the **true gift of giving is sharing your time and knowledge**.

---

### The Classroom Moments

Each session with the kids was filled with curiosity and laughter.  
Their eagerness to learn made me look forward to every weekend.

Sometimes, all they needed was someone to listen, to encourage, to guide.  
And being that person felt like the most rewarding thing I could do.

### What I Discovered

Through VITeach, I discovered that:

- Giving doesn’t reduce what you have — it multiplies it
- Teaching is as much about listening as it is about speaking
- The smallest acts can leave the deepest impact

---

### Reflection

The smiles, the thank-yous, and the little achievements of the children will always stay in my heart.  
VITeach taught me that **the greatest gift is the joy of giving**.
