# A Journey Worth Taking

_By Chaitanya (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

When I first heard about VITeach, I wasn’t sure what it would be like.  
I thought it might be just another activity to add to my resume.

But as the weeks passed, I realized it was **so much more than that**.

### The Turning Point

During one of the sessions, a child came up to me and said,  
“Anna, I understood what you taught today!”

That one line made all the effort worthwhile.  
It showed me the **impact** we were creating, no matter how small it seemed.

### Lessons Along the Way

Being part of VITeach taught me:

- Responsibility towards society
- The power of patience and persistence
- That true satisfaction lies in helping others

---

### Reflection

Looking back, I can say this was truly a journey worth taking.  
VITeach not only gave me memories but also shaped me into a more compassionate person.
