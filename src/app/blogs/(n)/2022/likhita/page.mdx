# Little Teachers

_By Likitha (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

I always believed that teaching was a one-way process — the teacher gives, and the student receives.  
But after joining **VITeach**, I realized how wrong I was.

### The First Class

The very first time I entered the classroom, the children’s excitement filled the air.  
They were eager to learn, but what surprised me most was how much **I** ended up learning from them.

They were my **little teachers**.

### What They Taught Me

The kids showed me:

- How to be curious about everything
- How to enjoy the little moments
- How to find happiness in simplicity

---

### Reflection

Every session at the school reminded me that education is a two-way street.  
I may have gone there to teach, but I always came back with something new learned.

That’s the true beauty of VITeach — it makes you realize that **we are all students, always learning**.
