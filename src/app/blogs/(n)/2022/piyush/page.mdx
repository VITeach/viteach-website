# Beyond the Classroom

_By Piyush (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

When I joined VITeach, I thought it would just be about teaching kids some English or Math.  
But soon I realized it was much more than that.

### The Real Experience

Every visit to the school was different.  
Sometimes the kids would surprise us with their questions, sometimes with their creativity.

It wasn’t only about textbooks — it was about sharing experiences, ideas, and laughter.

I understood that **true education goes beyond the classroom**.  
It’s about learning values, empathy, and resilience.

### Lessons I Took Back

From the children, I learned:

- How to stay curious
- How to be happy with little things
- How to keep pushing forward despite challenges

---

### Reflection

VITeach gave me memories and lessons that no lecture hall could ever provide.  
It showed me that teaching is not one-way — it’s a journey where both sides grow together.
