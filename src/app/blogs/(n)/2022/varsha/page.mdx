# Smiles that Stay

_By Varsha (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

When I first joined VIT, everything felt overwhelming — new place, new people, new experiences.  
Amidst all this, **VITeach** gave me something steady and meaningful.

---

### The Experience

Every weekend, when we went to the school, the children’s faces would light up with joy.  
Their smiles stayed with me long after the sessions were over.

It wasn’t just about teaching them — it was about being there for them, encouraging them, and learning from them.

### What I Learned

From VITeach, I learned:

- The importance of kindness
- How little efforts can make a big difference
- That true happiness comes from giving, not receiving

---

### Reflection

The smiles I received in return were priceless.  
Even today, when I think about VITeach, it’s those smiles that I cherish the most.

They will always stay with me.
