# Something Different!

### My Journey with VITeach

I joined the club because I wanted to experience this field, but little did I know that the time we got to spend with the children was invaluable.

From a person who never thought she could mingle with kids, to a person who loves going to school just to meet them, it has been a short, yet amazing journey.

More than teaching them English, I was busy learning Tamil.  
The children are always eager to learn and always test our limits to innovative ways of teaching, which makes it interesting for us as well because it’s something different from what we do in our college.

It’s always a really warm experience to spend time with them and teach them.
