### Preface

When I joined VIT, I was looking for opportunities to do something meaningful apart from academics.  
That’s when I found **VITeach** — and it turned out to be one of the best choices I made.

### The Experience

Going to school every week was something I looked forward to.  
The children welcomed us with so much excitement that all my stress would just melt away.

At first, I thought teaching them might be difficult.  
But soon I realized that **teaching is actually the best way to learn**.  
Every time I explained something to them, I understood it more deeply myself.

### Lessons Beyond Books

The kids taught me:

- Patience
- The value of small joys
- How to look at life with curiosity

It was never just about academics — it was about sharing smiles, stories, and experiences.

### Reflection

My journey with VITeach made my time in VIT truly special.  
It gave me not only memories but also life lessons that will stay with me forever.
