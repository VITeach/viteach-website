# “Meeting them made me forget about every tension that I had!”

### Preface

It was during the first year that I had an orientation and I came across many technical and non-technical clubs in the college.  
There was one club, **VITeach**, which was introduced to us as a social outreach club by the ex-General Secretary G. Amritha.

After the orientation I requested her to accept me in the club. She told me to be present in the curtain-raiser and I did so.  
There I met Sanjay Bhaiya (ex-president) and he asked me an unexpected question:

> “You won’t get OD for going to school and you have to take out time for doing activities, so why are you joining the club?”

My answer was:

> “To enrich the learning experience of the kids and to see a smile on those faces.”

He added me to the group and asked me to join a team and as expected, I chose the school team.

### Challenges

I used to go to school twice a week and there have been days when I went alone.  
Everything you do brings a challenge along with it and you are bound to face it.

For me, the biggest challenge was to communicate with the children in school as I didn’t know Tamil.

I discussed it with my seniors and they helped me a lot. I used to ask my friends (who knew Tamil) to explain subjects to kids in school.  
And especially for this, I learned Tamil (beginner level) so it could be easier for me to make them understand.  
Believe me — **“language is not a barrier to communication.”**

### Smile on Faces

In my first year, there was a sports day held in ADW school and we divided the children into 4 houses, each comprising 15–16 students.  
And I can’t describe the feeling of euphoria they had — they wanted to defeat the opponent, but they were reluctant to make their friends sad too.

We also took an initiative to celebrate Teacher’s Day in ADW school and the teachers of that school were thrilled with our initiative.

After school used to get over, the children would come running to us and say _“bye anna”_.  
The feeling we had at that moment can’t be replicated by any means, they gave such an overwhelming response.  
I may be in whatever mood while going to school, but whenever I used to meet those kids and see their smiling faces, I don’t know what magic they had — but I used to forget about everything and just wanted to understand them and learn from them the true sense of happiness.

Meeting them made me forget about every tension that I had.  
I can’t explain those feelings in words.

### Reflection

My 1.5 years in VITeach has been the best time of my life with a lot of happiness, anger, disappointments, clash of thoughts — and always the outcome was to make VITeach a better club, and everybody accepted it.

In life, there will come many opportunities, but it is up to you whether you want to grab it or let it go.  
If you fail, try to fail big — then only will you know what it feels to be successful.
