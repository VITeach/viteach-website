# A New Perspective

_By Ridhi Anand (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

I joined VITeach with no clear expectations.  
All I knew was that it involved teaching kids and helping them learn new things.

But what I didn’t know was that it would give **me** a new perspective on life.

### First Experience

The first time I went to school, I was nervous.  
Would the children understand me? Would I be able to explain anything to them?  
But all my doubts vanished when I was greeted with their innocent smiles.

They were so eager to learn, so curious — and it struck me how different their world was from ours.

### Lessons Learned

I realized that **teaching is not just about books**.  
It’s about patience, understanding, and sometimes just being there for them.

Every time I taught them something new, they taught me something too:

- To be happy with little things
- To value relationships
- To never stop asking questions

### Reflection

VITeach didn’t just give me a platform to teach — it gave me a chance to grow.  
It showed me that education is not one-way; it’s a shared journey.

And today, when I look back, I feel grateful that I got the opportunity to be a part of something so meaningful.
