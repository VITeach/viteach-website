# A Walk to Remember

### Preface

When I first joined VITeach, I didn’t know what to expect.  
It sounded like just another club at first, but soon I realized it was much more than that.

### The First Day

The first day I went to school, the kids looked at us with curiosity.  
They didn’t know us, and we didn’t know them — but slowly, that barrier started to fade away.

I still remember a little boy who came up to me and asked,  
“Anna, will you come again tomorrow?”

That simple question struck a chord.  
It made me realize how much our presence meant to them.

### Beyond Teaching

It wasn’t just about academics.  
Sometimes, we played games, sometimes we just listened to their stories.

I understood that for them, we weren’t just teachers — we were mentors, friends, and sometimes even family.

### Reflection

This journey has been nothing less than a walk to remember.  
Every smile, every innocent question, every thank-you made me value life in a way I had never done before.

VITeach gave me memories to treasure and lessons to carry forward.
