# The Joy of Giving

_By Ashutosh (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

When I heard about VITeach during the orientation, I was curious.  
It wasn’t just another technical club — it was something different, something closer to the heart.

---

### First Visit

The first time I visited the school, I was nervous.  
But the moment the children smiled at me, all my hesitation vanished.

They were eager to learn, full of energy, and their curiosity was infectious.  
I realized that even small efforts from us could bring a huge difference in their lives.

### What I Learned

Being a part of VITeach taught me:

- To value the joy of giving over receiving
- To find happiness in small things
- That teaching is as much about listening as it is about speaking

---

### Reflection

Looking back, I feel grateful for the opportunity.  
VITeach didn’t just give me a platform to teach — it gave me a chance to grow as a person.

The joy of giving, the bonds we built, and the lessons I learned will stay with me forever.
