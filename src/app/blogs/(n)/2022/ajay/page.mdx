# Teaching to Learn

_By Ajay (2022 Batch)_

### Preface

When I joined VITeach, I thought I would simply be teaching kids basic subjects.  
But very soon, I realized that **teaching is the best way to learn**.

---

### The Experience

Every class brought new challenges.  
Sometimes the kids wouldn’t understand right away, and I had to think of new ways to explain.  
In doing so, **my own concepts became clearer**.

---

### Lessons Learned

From VITeach, I understood that:

- Teaching builds patience and creativity
- Knowledge grows only when shared
- True learning happens when we step out of our comfort zone

---

### Reflection

The time I spent with the children not only made me a better teacher but also a better learner.  
VITeach showed me that learning and teaching go hand in hand — they complete each other.
