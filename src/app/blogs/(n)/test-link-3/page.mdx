# Inheritance is Dead? Go Says Yes, Java Says Never!

Okay, I'll admit the title is total clickbait. If you came here for a hot take on why Java sucks and Go is its rightful heir in big tech, then sorry to say, I tricked you. Hehe. But hey, since you're already here, why not stick around? You might just gain a new perspective on how different design paradigms can help build software for a future we can't even imagine yet.

For context, I've used both Java and Go long enough to develop a healthy love-hate relationship with each. This gives me a pretty clear view of their actual differencesâ€”not just in terms of verbosity, performance, or fandom, but in their core ideologies for writing software: **inheritance versus composition**.

Before we dive in, let's take a quick look at the history of both languages. Feel free to skip ahead if you're already familiar with their origin stories or just don't care.
