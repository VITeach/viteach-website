### Preface

> “If you and I unite together, we can make a significant impact in the field of empowering education.”

While researching for the “Legacy of VITeach” post, I stumbled upon an event called Kid's Sunday, which our seniors had hosted in 2016–17. This discovery inspired me, fueling a long‑held desire to recreate a similar event.

On April 20, 2024, VITeach organized EmpowerED — an initiative toward SDG Goal 4: Quality Education — where we welcomed the children of VIT Chennai housekeeping staff into our classroom.

Although I couldn’t be there in person, I followed the event virtually. Hearing the experiences of both students and volunteers was incredibly fulfilling. Experiencing it as a viewer, leader, and volunteer all at once sparked the idea to write this blog!

### The Fun-Filled Learning Day

With over 43 students and 25 volunteers, the aim was to foster interest in Spoken English among the students.

- The day began with a “Guess the Animal” game where animal sounds were played and the children guessed the animal.
- A session on adjectives expanded their vocabulary with presentations prepared by the School Team.
- Hands-on science experiments included invisible ink, surface tension with soap‑water‑pepper, and refraction.
- After the mid‑day meal, the children showcased their talents in a talent show.
- A session on prepositions followed, with worksheets.
- Finally, the kids created “Thank You” cards, translating their messages into English with volunteer support.

The day concluded with a Stationery Drive distribution, filling the children with joy and gratitude.
