# Our Story

> "Kindness can transform someone's dark moment with a blaze of light. At the end it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplished. It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back."

VITeach is a student‑run social outreach club at VIT Chennai, committed towards educating and imparting values to underprivileged children. With the collaboration of students from all the batches and branches, the two major projects – Adi Dravida Nadunilai Palli at Melakottaiyur and Government High School at Kandigai – have been significantly brightening the lives of the children there.

Our club aims at teaching students the basics of STEM, English and History in both English and their native tongue, Tamil. With the emergence of e‑learning as the primary means of education, we've been producing educational videos and online study materials for these children to learn from, at the comfort of their homes.

Throughout the academic years, we conduct sessions where children are encouraged to learn through games, skits, contests and events along with co‑curricular activities like sports, visual arts, dancing, yoga etc. We also celebrate festivals in the schools while helping the children understand the cultural values behind the celebrations.

Being a part of VITeach is one of the most amazing and fulfilling experiences that our members have had at VIT. The club enables each and every member to contribute to their fullest, from teaching school students to curating better teaching methods and syllabus to conducting a plethora of events and talks and to now creating animated digital content for the students. However small or big, VITeachers get to leave a lasting positive impact on the lives we aim to change.
